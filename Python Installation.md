# Instructions for Installing Python

This guide is to provide you with a quick and easy to follow walkthrough on the installation process of the Python programming language on your local desktop computer or laptop. Click here to go to Python.org to download.

### 1. Click the Download Python 3.9.7 button

Python is compatible with Windows, macOS, multiple different Linux distributions, and a few other select operating systems. If you need a specific version of Python you can find a list of all the previous releases on the download page towards the bottom as well. The download should only take a few seconds to complete.


### 2. Click the Downloaded python-3.X.X.exe file

Allow the program to make changes to your computer. Run as an administrator if necessary. The executable file will bring up the Python Setup Installer.


### 3. Select Install for all users

This will give access and install Python 3.x for all users on your local desktop computer or laptop. Click the next button.


### 4. Choose the Installation Destination Directory for Python

Select the directory where you wish to install Python. You can leave this as the default file path which it recommends and click next to move onto more installation options. You will most likely not need to change the location unless you feel that it is necessary to place it somewhere else.


### 5. Select the Customization Options

I would recommend to leave these settings as the default options provided by the installer. Click the next button.


### 6. Click Finish After the Installation Process Completes

Click finish to complete the installation process and exit the installer. If you need more information on the installation process, please refer to the documentation provided by Python.org.


## Instructions for Upgrading Python to a Newer Version

If you already have Python installed on your local desktop computer or laptop, and need to update to a newer release version you can do so through a similar method as the installation process.

### 1. Click the Download Python 3.9.7 button.

Python is compatible with Windows, macOS, multiple different Linux distributions, and a few other select operating systems. The download should only take a few seconds to complete.


### 2. Click the Downloaded python-3.X.X.exe file

Allow the program to make changes to your computer. Run as an administrator if necessary. The executable file will bring up the Python Setup Installer.


### 3. Select the Upgrade Now option

You can directly replace the previously installed version of Python without changing any of your installation settings from your initial download.


### 4. The Installer will Provide a Visualization of the Setup Progress

Once the update installation completes it will bring you to a new page.


### 5. Click Close After the Setup Process Completes

The update to a newer Python release version has been completed. I would recommend restarting your local desktop computer or laptop to ensure that the installation process completed properly.


## Integrated Developer Environments

Now that the newest release version of Python has been installed onto your local machine, I would recommend installing an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) as well.
